# Food Vision Model

## Project Description

This project is a deep learning-based food classification model, aimed at recognizing and classifying images of food. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, the model was trained on the **101 Food Dataset**, which consists of various food categories. The model can classify food images into their respective categories with an accuracy of **90%**, making it highly efficient for real-world food recognition applications.

The Food Vision Model is designed for use cases such as restaurant recommendation systems, dietary tracking applications, or any other food-related AI solution that requires accurate image classification.

## Dataset

- **101 Food Dataset**: This dataset contains images of various food categories, providing a rich variety of food images for training the model.

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 90%
